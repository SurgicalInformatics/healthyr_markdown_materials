# Data and set-up

Loading the packages:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(gapminder)

```

We will be using the gapminder dataset:

```{r}

mydata = gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercap = round(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(pop_millions = (pop/1e6) %>% round(1)) %>% 
  select(-pop)

```

A random sample of rows in the dataset:
```{r}

mydata %>% 
  sample_n(10) %>% 
  kable()


```

Number of variables: `r mydata %>% ncol()`.

Total number of observations: `r mydata %>% nrow()`.

```{r}

mydata$year %>% unique()

# n_distinct() is a faster and more concise alternative to unique(x) %>% length():
n_years     = mydata$year    %>% n_distinct()
n_countries = mydata$country %>% n_distinct()

```

The number of countries included in the dataset is `r n_countries` and the number of years is `r n_years`. Is every country represented every year:

```{r}

n_years*n_countries == mydata %>% nrow()

```

# Plotting

```{r}

mydata %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(  aes(x      = gdpPercap/1000, #divide by 1000 to tidy the x-axis
               y      = lifeExp,
               colour = continent,
               size   = pop_millions)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  theme_bw()

  
```
